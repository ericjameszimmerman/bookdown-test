# Case study: mining NASA metadata

## Summary

By using a combination of network analysis, tf-idf, and topic modeling, we have come to a greater understanding of how datasets are related at NASA. Specifically, we have more information now about how keywords are connected to each other and which datasets are likely to be related. The topic model could be used to suggest keywords based on the words in the description field, or the work on the keywords could suggest the most important combination of keywords for certain areas of study.
